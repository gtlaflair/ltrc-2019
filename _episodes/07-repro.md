title: "Part 3: Reproducible Reporting"
teaching: 60
exercises: 35
questions:
  - "How do I automate score reporting?"
  - "How do I combine my analysis and reporting?"
objectives:
   - "Write a command that will print score reports for your test takers."
   - "Create a presentation that includes code, prose, and results."
keypoints:
   - "R and RStudio can be used to carry out reproducible test analyses and reporting."

The purpose of this part of the workshop is to illustrate how R and RStudio can be leveraged to create a reproducible pipeline for analysis and reporting. Some of the parts in this section move beyond analysis. We will spend just enough time with them to grasp the basics.

There are quite a few R packages that have been created to promote reproducible research. Some of these packages are tools for
accessing databases, some are tools for managing projects, and others are tools for creating reproducible reports. A couple of groups, RStudio and ROpenSci, and people affiliated (officially and unofficially) with them have led the way in this. Today, the main packages that we will be using to learn about this are `knitr`, `rmarkdown`, and `tinytex`. `knitr` is an ["engine for dynamic report generation with R"](https://yihui.name/knitr/), `rmarkdown` is a ["file format for making dynamic documents with R"](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/articles_intro.html), and `tinytex` is a subset of $\LaTeX$ [packages from a larger distribution](https://yihui.name/tinytex/). This last package we will use first and only once to install the $\LaTeX$ distribution on your computer. It makes creating PDF documents easier.

We will interact with `knitr` primarily through the button in RStudio and through the use of its `kable` function to create tables.

You can think of an rmarkdown file, or an .Rmd, file in the same way you think of a .docx file. A place to do writing. Writing in a .Rmd file differs in that  you can include R code in your writing, and you do not do heavy formatting in the file. Below is an example of R chunks (in grey) embedded in prose (we saw this code and this prose in the lesson on data visualization). The "chunks" start with ` ```{r}` and end with ` ``` `. This is like a mini-environment for R code. The chunks can be named, and there are parameters that can be set globally across chunks or specifically for one chunk such as `fig.width` to control the width of figures and `echo` to indicate the printing of code with results or not.
