Day 2 Problem Set

HINT: You can start working in a standard R script. Then, once your analyses and plots
look fine, start a new R Notebook and begin laying things out - you can copy your code
from the script and place it in chunks in your R Notebook. Or you can read it into your 
.Rmd document at the top using `source` and then call on the objects you want to print
in your chunks.

You can download a prepped document or start your own.
