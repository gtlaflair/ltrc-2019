For this portion of the workshop, we will work on creating a research report. There are a lot methods for doing this that range from "quick and easy" to more complicated with more formatting options (e.g. the `papaja` package for creating APA manuscripts). We are going to work with the quick and easy method :).

To start a .Rmd file go to File > New file > Rmarkdown. Save it in the documents folder. Let's also start a new .R file for this part (`file.create('scripts/report.R')`)
