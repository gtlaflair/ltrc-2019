For this portion of the workshop, we will work on creating a research report. There are a lot methods for doing this. One in particular involves using Frederik Aust's and Marius Barth's `papaja` package for creating APA manuscripts. This can be installed from GitHub: `devtools::install_github("crsh/papaja")`

You can download a prepped .Rmd file for this into your documents folder using the function below.
