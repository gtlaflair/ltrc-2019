## R and RStudio

R is an open source programming language originally designed and implemented by
statisticians primarily for statistical analysis. It includes high quality
graphics capabilities and tools for data analysis and reading and writing data
to/from files.

Because R is open source and is supported by a large community of developers and
users, there is a very large selection of third-party add-on packages which are
freely available to extend R's native capabilities.

R is a scripted language. Rather than pointing and clicking in a graphical
environment, you write code statements to ask R to do something for you. This has
the advantage of providing a record of what was done and allowing for peer review
of the work undertaken. Having this written record, something which is increasingly
required as part of a publication submission, is also an aid when seeking help
with problems.

There are many online resources, such as
[stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r) and the [RStudio
Community](https://community.rstudio.com/), which will allow you to seek help
from peers. Questions which are backed up with [short, reproducible code
snippets](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/) are more likely to attract knowledgeable responses.

To make it easier to interact with R, we will use RStudio. RStudio is the most popular IDE (Integrated Development Interface) for R. An IDE is a piece of software that provides tools to make programming easier.

## A tour of RStudio



## Knowing your way around RStudio

Let's start by learning about [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), which is an
Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for working with R.

The RStudio IDE open-source product is free under the
[Affero General Public License (AGPL) v3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html).
The RStudio IDE is also available with a commercial license and priority email
support from RStudio, Inc.

We will use the RStudio IDE to write code, navigate the files on our computer,
inspect the variables we create, and visualize the plots we generate. RStudio
can also be used for other things (e.g., version control, developing packages,
writing Shiny apps) that we will not cover during the workshop.

One of the advantages of using RStudio is that all the information
you need to write code is available in a single window. Additionally, RStudio
provides many shortcuts, autocompletion, and highlighting for the major file
types you use while developing in R. RStudio makes typing easier and less
error-prone.


## Getting set up

It is good practice to keep a set of related data, analyses, and text
self-contained in a single folder called the **working directory**. All of the
scripts within this folder can then use *relative paths* to files. Relative paths
indicate where inside the project a file is located (as opposed to absolute paths,
which point to where a file is on a specific computer). Working this way makes it
a lot easier to move your project around on your computer and share it with
others without having to directly modify file paths in the individual scripts.

RStudio provides a helpful set of tools to do this through its "Projects"
interface, which not only creates a working directory for you but also remembers
its location (allowing you to quickly navigate to it). The interface also
(optionally) preserves custom settings and open files to make it easier to
resume work after a break. Below, we will go through the steps to create
an "R Project" for this tutorial. First, let's take a quick tour of RStudio.

![RStudio_startup](../fig/R_00_Rstudio_01.png)

RStudio is divided into four "panes": the **Source** for your scripts and documents
(top left in the default layout), the R **Console** (bottom left), your
**Environment/History** (top right), and your
**Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer** (bottom right). The placement of these
panes and their content can be customized (see menu, Tools -> Global Options ->
Pane Layout).


### Create a new project

* Under the `File` menu, click on `New project`, choose `New directory`, then
  `New project`
* Enter a name for this new folder (or "directory") and choose a convenient
  location for it. This will be your **working directory** for the rest of the
  day (e.g., `~/ltrc-workshop`)
* Click on `Create project`
* Create a new folder called `scripts`. In the console, type `dir.create(scripts)`,
You should see a folder in the bottom right window called scripts.
* Create a new file where we will type our scripts. Go to File > New File > R
  script. Click the save icon on your toolbar and save your script as
  "`script.R`".

### Organizing your working directory

Using a consistent folder structure across your projects will help keep things
organized and make it easy to find/file things in the future. This
can be especially helpful when you have multiple projects. In general, you might
create directories (folders) for **scripts**, **data**, and **documents**. Here
are some examples of suggested directories:

 - **`data/`** Use this folder to store your raw data and intermediate datasets.
   For the sake of transparency and [provenance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provenance), you
   should *always* keep a copy of your raw data accessible and do as much of
   your data cleanup and preprocessing programmatically (i.e., with scripts,
   rather than manually) as possible.
 - **`data_output/`** When you need to modify your raw data,
   it might be useful to store the modified versions of the datasets in a different folder.
 - **`documents/`** Used for outlines, drafts, and other
   text.
 - **`fig_output/`** This folder can store the graphics that are generated
   by your scripts.
 - **`scripts/`** A place to keep your R scripts for
   different analyses or plotting.

You may want additional directories or subdirectories depending on your project
needs, but these should form the backbone of your working directory. Use the `dir.create`
function to create the other folders.

![Example of a working directory structure](../fig/working-directory-structure.png)

### The working directory

The working directory is an important concept to understand. It is the place
where R will look for and save files. When you write code for
your project, your scripts should refer to files in relation to the root of your working
directory and only to files within this structure.

Using RStudio projects makes this easy and ensures that your working directory
is set up properly. If you need to check it, you can use `getwd()`. If for some
reason your working directory is not what it should be, you can change it in the
RStudio interface by navigating in the file browser to where your working directory
should be, clicking on the blue gear icon "More", and selecting "Set As Working
Directory". Alternatively, you can use `setwd("/path/to/working/directory")` to
reset your working directory. However, your scripts should not include this line,
because it will fail on someone else's computer.


### Downloading the data and getting set up

For this workshop we will use the following folders in our working directory: **`data/`**, **`data_output/`**, **`fig_output/`**, **`documents`**, and **`scripts`**. Let's write them all in lowercase to be consistent. We can create them using the RStudio interface by clicking on the "New Folder" button in the file pane (bottom right), or directly from R by typing at console:


~~~
dir.create("data")
dir.create("data_output")
dir.create("documents")
dir.create("fig_output")
# dir.create("scripts") # we have already done this; doing it again would erase what we have created in the current folder
~~~
{: .language-r}

The data for this workshop can all be found at its GitHub repository <https://github.com/gtlaflair/ltrc-2019/data>. You can download it directly to your computer by running the commands below in R or RStudio. The names in all of the datasets are fake; they were generated using the `charlatan` package from [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/).


~~~
download.file("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gtlaflair/ltrc-2019/gh-pages/data/placement_1.csv",
              "data/placement_1.csv", mode = "wb")

download.file("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gtlaflair/ltrc-2019/gh-pages/data/placement_2.csv",
              "data/placement_2.csv", mode = "wb")

download.file("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gtlaflair/ltrc-2019/gh-pages/data/integrated.csv",
              "data/integrated.csv", mode = "wb")

## Interacting with R

The basis of programming is that we write down instructions for the computer to
follow, and then we tell the computer to follow those instructions. We write, or
*code*, instructions in R because it is a common language that both the computer
and we can understand. We call the instructions *commands* and we tell the
computer to follow the instructions by *executing* (also called *running*) those
commands.

There are two main ways of interacting with R: by using the console or by using
script files (plain text files that contain your code). The console pane (in
RStudio, the bottom left panel) is the place where commands written in the R
language can be typed and executed immediately by the computer. It is also where
the results will be shown for commands that have been executed. You can type
commands directly into the console and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to execute those commands,
but they will be forgotten when you close the session.

Because we want our code and workflow to be reproducible, it is better to type
the commands we want in the script editor and save the script. This way, there
is a complete record of what we did, and anyone (including our future selves!)
can easily replicate the results on their computer.

RStudio allows you to execute commands directly from the script editor by using
the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> shortcut (on Mac, <kbd>Cmd</kbd> +
<kbd>Return</kbd> will work). The command on the current line in the
script (indicated by the cursor) or all of the commands in
selected text will be sent to the console and executed when you press
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd>. You can find other keyboard shortcuts in this [RStudio cheatsheet about the RStudio IDE](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/rstudio-ide.pdf).

At some point in your analysis, you may want to check the content of a variable
or the structure of an object without necessarily keeping a record of it in
your script. You can type these commands and execute them directly in the
console.  RStudio provides the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>1</kbd> and
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>2</kbd> shortcuts allow you to jump between the
script and the console panes.

If R is ready to accept commands, the R console shows a `>` prompt. If R
receives a command (by typing, copy-pasting, or sent from the script editor using
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd>), R will try to execute it and, when
ready, will show the results and come back with a new `>` prompt to wait for new
commands.

If R is still waiting for you to enter more text,
the console will show a `+` prompt. It means that you haven't finished entering
a complete command. This is likely because you have not 'closed' a parenthesis or
quotation, i.e. you don't have the same number of left-parentheses as
right-parentheses or the same number of opening and closing quotation marks.
When this happens, and you thought you finished typing your command, click
inside the console window and press <kbd>Esc</kbd>; this will cancel the
incomplete command and return you to the `>` prompt. You can then proofread
the command(s) you entered and correct the error.


## Installing additional packages using the packages tab

In addition to the core R installation, there are in excess of
10,000 additional packages which can be used to extend the
functionality of R. Many of these have been written by R users and
have been made available in central repositories, like the one
hosted at CRAN, for anyone to download and install into their own R
environment. In the course of this lesson we will be making use of
several of these packages, such as 'ggplot2' and 'dplyr'.

Additional packages can be installed from the ‘packages’ tab.
On the packages tab, click the ‘Install’ icon and start typing the
name of the package you want in the text box. As you type, packages
matching your starting characters will be displayed in a drop-down
list so that you can select them.

![Install Packages Window](../fig/R_00_Rstudio_03.png)

At the bottom of the Install Packages window is a check box to
‘Install’ dependencies. This is ticked by default, which is usually
what you want. Packages can (and do) make use of functionality
built into other packages, so for the functionality contained in
the package you are installing to work properly, there may be other
packages which have to be installed with them. The ‘Install
dependencies’ option makes sure that this happens.

> ## Exercise
>
> Use the install option from the packages tab to install the ‘tidyverse’ package.
>
> > ## Solution
> > From the packages tab, click ‘Install’ from the toolbar and type ‘tidyverse’ into the textbox, then click ‘install’.
> > The ‘tidyverse’ package is really a package of packages, including 'ggplot2' and 'dplyr', both of which require other packages to run correctly. All of these packages will be installed automatically.
> > Depending on what packages have previously been installed in your R environment, the install of ‘tidyverse’ could be very quick or could take several minutes.
> > As the install proceeds, messages relating to its progress will be written to the console. You will be able to see all of the packages which are actually being installed.
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

Because the install process accesses the CRAN repository, you
will need an Internet connection to install packages.

It is also possible to install packages from other repositories, as
well as Github or the local file system.

## Installing additional packages using R code

There are a few packages that we forgot to ask you to install before coming
today. We will do that now. We will explain what these packages do as we use them.
